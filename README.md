# Hi there, I'm Ruan. 👋
Currently, I am working as a Senior Full-Stack Engineer at [Utilifeed](https://www.utilifeed.com/).

### *Senior Full-Stack Engineer*
**Based in Gothenburg, Sweden 🇸🇪**


I build distributed systems that handle millions of events without waking me up at 3 AM.

Currently, I spend my time bridging the gap between "product wants this" and "the server can do this." I focus on **technical direction** for the frontend (React/Typescript) and helping the team ship complex features without breaking production.

### 🧠 The Philosophy (Likes & Hates)

I have strong opinions, loosely held. (Except the database one. That is firmly held.)

**✅ Things I Like**
* **Solving the "Weird" Problems:** If it involves obscure edge cases, distributed race conditions, or protocols nobody remembers, I'm interested.
* **Building Cool Things:** Whether it's a massive event ingestion pipeline or a small automation script, I like shipping software that actually works.
* **Game Dev:** My occasional side quest. Dabbling in engines and logic keeps the creativity flowing.

**❌ Things I Hate**
* **"Pizza & Deploy" Evenings:** If you can't trust your CI/CD pipeline to deploy at 2 PM on a Tuesday, something is fundamentally wrong. Deployments should be boring, not a social event.
* **Non-Relational Databases:** My brain demands structure. Give me a schema or give me death.
* **Timezones:** There is a special circle of hell reserved for handling Daylight Savings Time changes in distributed logs.

### 💬 Let's Talk

I am always open to discussing **System Design**, **Golang vs. Rust** (Go is better), or why SQL is still king.
